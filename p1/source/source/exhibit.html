					<h3>Extended through April 14th</h3>
					<h4>Guest Curator: Ted Mann</h4>
					<hr/>
					<p>
			Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
			Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York,
			this exhibition features the first realization of a
			participatory environment Nauman conceived in 1970. The work
			is a narrow passageway that wraps around an existing room,
			combining colored fluorescent light and closed-circuit video
			to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience. An adjacent
			gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor within the
			artist’s career.

			Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries
			of art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
			beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
			studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman
			was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed
			process and activity over static, predetermined forms, and
			that took up language and the body as materials. Unbound by
			traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
			between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography,
			drawing, printmaking, and large-scale installation.

			This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
			co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the
			Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over twenty
			years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to
			survey the full breadth of Nauman's work, the present
			exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum focuses on a single,
			exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
			from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some
			forty corridors, rooms, and other architectural installations.
			The majority of these installations have been built for
			exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow
			Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on paper, in
			the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman originally
			developed the concept for this particular work in three
			drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first
			time that the installation has actually been realized.
