TRANSLATION:
We decided to translate the english in real time, rather than have it translate on the "enter" key.

 - Used to calculate the height of a textarea to allow it to dynamically grow.

Running the Server:
  node langoServer

Getting to the app:
  You can either use http://server162.site:[port#]/user/lango.html or directly
  go to http://server162.site:[port#]/login.html.

  Also the db is currently empty, so you will need to create some cards first before moving onto the review page.
